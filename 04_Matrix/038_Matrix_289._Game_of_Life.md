# 038_Matrix_289. Game of Life

According to [Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life): "The **Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

The board is made up of an `m x n` grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: **live** (represented by a `1`) or **dead** (represented by a `0`). Each cell interacts with its [eight neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the `m x n` grid `board`, return *the next state*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JedLee6/PublicPicBed/main/uPic/grid2.jpg)

```
Input: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 25`
- `board[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

 

**Follow up:**

- Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
- In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?



Absolutely! The Game of Life is a fascinating problem that can showcase a candidate's ability to work with two-dimensional arrays and apply logical rules efficiently. Let's break down the solution, step by step, and discuss multiple approaches to solving this problem in Java.

## Intuition and Main Idea

The Game of Life is essentially about updating the board state based on its own current state with a set of rules that govern cell life and death. A challenge here is to update all cells simultaneously, which means the new state of a cell should not influence the updating of another cell within the same generation.

## Approach: In-place Update with State Encoding

To optimize space usage, you can encode the states to record a cell's current and future state simultaneously. For example:

```erlang
[2nd bit, 1st bit] = [next state, current state]
- 0 00  dead (next) <- dead (current)
- 1 01  dead (next) <- live (current)  
- 2 10  live (next) <- dead (current)  
- 3 11  live (next) <- live (current) 
```

This allows us to use the lower bit to represent the current state and the higher bit to represent the future state, updating all cells based on the original states without needing extra space.

- In the beginning, every cell is either `00` or `01`.
- Notice that `1st` state is independent of `2nd` state.
- Imagine all cells are instantly changing from the `1st` to the `2nd` state, at the same time.
- Let's count the number of live neighbors from `1st` state and set `2nd` state bit.
- Since every `2nd` state is by default dead, no need to consider transition `01 -> 00`.
- In the end, delete every cell's `1st` state by doing `>> 1`.

For each cell's `1st` bit, check the 8 pixels around itself, and set the cell's `2nd` bit.

- Transition `01 -> 11`: when `board == 1` and `lives >= 2 && lives <= 3`.
- Transition `00 -> 10`: when `board == 0` and `lives == 3`.

To get the current state, simply do `board[i][j] & 1`, to get the next state, simply do `board[i][j] >> 1`.

## Code Implementation

```java
public void gameOfLife(int[][] board) {
    // Check if the input board is null or empty to avoid errors in processing.
    if (board == null || board.length == 0)
        return;
    // rL is the number of rows, cL is the number of columns in the board.
    int rL = board.length, cL = board[0].length;
    // Traverse each cell of the board using nested loops.
    for (int r = 0; r < rL; r++) {
        for (int c = 0; c < cL; c++) {
            int lives = 0; // Initialize live neighbor count for the current cell.
            // Check all neighboring cells, ensuring boundaries are respected.
            for (int x = Math.max(r - 1, 0); x <= Math.min(r + 1, rL - 1); x++) {
                for (int y = Math.max(c - 1, 0); y <= Math.min(c + 1, cL - 1); y++) {
                    // Count live neighbors; use `& 1` to read only the least significant bit (current state).
                    lives += board[x][y] & 1;
                }
            }
            // Subtract the state of the current cell because it was included in the neighbor count.
            lives -= board[r][c] & 1;

            // Rules implementation using bitwise operations.
            // Check if the cell is alive and has 2 or 3 live neighbors.
            if (board[r][c] == 1 && lives >= 2 && lives <= 3) {
                // Cell remains alive; set the 2nd bit to 1: from 01 to 11.
                board[r][c] = 3;
            }
            // Check if the cell is dead and has exactly 3 live neighbors.
            if (board[r][c] == 0 && lives == 3) {
                // Cell becomes alive; set the 2nd bit to 1: from 00 to 10.
                board[r][c] = 2;
            }
        }
    }
    // Finalize the board by setting the next state.
    for (int i = 0; i < rL; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < cL; j++) {
            // Right shift by 1 to bring the 2nd bit to the least significant bit position.
            board[i][j] >>= 1;
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(rL * cL)\), where (rL) and (cL) are the number of rows and columns in the board, respectively. Each cell's neighbors are checked, but the operations are constant time.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), using the board itself for the update.
