# 052_Stack_20. Valid Parentheses

Given a string `s` containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "()"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `s` consists of parentheses only `'()[]{}'`.



### Main Idea

The best way to solve this problem is by using a stack data structure. The stack allows us to process the last seen open bracket first when encountering a close bracket, which is exactly what we need for this problem.

### Java Implementation with Detailed Annotations

```java
public boolean isValid(String s) {
    // Step 1: Create a stack to keep track of most recently seen unpaired opening brackets
    Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();    
    // Step 2: Create a hashmap to quickly find the matching opening bracket for a closing one.
    HashMap<Character, Character> mappings = new HashMap<>();
    mappings.put(')', '(');
    mappings.put('}', '{');
    mappings.put(']', '[');
    // Step 3: Iterate through each character in the string.
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        char c = s.charAt(i);
        // Step 4: Check if the current character is a closing bracket
        if (mappings.containsKey(c)) {
            // Step 5: Pop the top element of the stack (if it exists) or use a dummy value
            char topElement = stack.empty() ? '#' : stack.pop();
            // Step 6: Check if the popped element (bracket or `#`) matches the opening bracket got from HashMap
            if (topElement != mappings.get(c)) {
                return false; // If not, string is not valid.
            }
        } else {
            // Step 7: If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.
            stack.push(c);
        }
    }
    // Step 8: After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, all opening brackets had matching closing brackets. Otherwise, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so the string is invalid.
    return stack.isEmpty();
}
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the string, as we make one pass through the string.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) in the worst case (all opening brackets) due to the stack.

### Alternative Solution: Using Array Instead of Stack for Higher Performance

In environments where performance is critical, and the range of characters is limited (like this problem), an array can be used instead of a stack to potentially speed up operations due to better memory locality.

### Conclusion
The stack-based approach for validating brackets is not only optimal but also very intuitive once you understand the LIFO (last-in, first-out) nature of stacks. This method is commonly used in similar parsing/validation problems and is an essential technique for any developer to know, especially when discussing parsing tasks or compiler construction in interviews.
