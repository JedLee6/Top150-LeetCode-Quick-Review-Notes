# 056_Stack_224. Basic Calculator

Given a string `s` representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return *the result of the evaluation*.

**Note:** You are **not** allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "1 + 1"
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105`
- `s` consists of digits, `'+'`, `'-'`, `'('`, `')'`, and `' '`.
- `s` represents a valid expression.
- `'+'` is **not** used as a unary operation (i.e., `"+1"` and `"+(2 + 3)"` is invalid).
- `'-'` could be used as a unary operation (i.e., `"-1"` and `"-(2 + 3)"` is valid).
- There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
- Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.



### Intuition and Main Idea
The primary challenge of this problem is managing the arithmetic precedence and parentheses, which suggest a need for a way to temporarily hold values and operators until they can be resolved, particularly when dealing with nested expressions. Using a stack is a natural choice here because it allows us to handle the problem's inherent nested structure in a last-in-first-out manner, which is ideal for managing operations that are enclosed in parentheses.

### Solution Strategy
1. **Parse the String**: Convert the input string into a list of numbers and operators.
2. **Use a Stack for Operations**: Use a stack to manage operations and handle the nested structure caused by parentheses.
3. **Handle 5 possible input**: 
    1. digit: Convert character to digit and form the number, as the numbers can be continuous. For example, 23 equals 10 times 2 and plus 3.
    2. '+': Number is over, we can add the previous number and start a new number
    3. '-': Same as above
    4. '(': Push the previous result and the sign into the stack, set result to 0, just calculate the new result within the parenthesis.
    5. ')': Pop out the top two numbers from stack, first one is the sign before this pair of parenthesis, second is the temporary result before this pair of parenthesis. We add them together.

Finally, we have to handle the last number and operand, then return the result.

### Step-by-Step Solution: Using a Stack

```java
public int calculate(String s) {
    // Stack to hold results and signs of subexpressions
    Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
    int operand = 0; // Current number being formed from the string
    int result = 0; // Result of the current subexpression so far
    int sign = 1;  // Current sign in front of a number, 1 means positive, -1 means negative
    // Iterate over each character in the input string
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        char ch = s.charAt(i);
        // If the character is a digit
        if (Character.isDigit(ch)) {
            // Convert character to digit and form the number, as the numbers can be continuous. For example, 23 equals 10 times 2 and plus 3
            operand = 10 * operand + (int) (ch - '0');
        } else if (ch == '+') {
            // Encountering '+' means we can compute the previous number
            result += sign * operand;
            sign = 1; // Update sign as positive for the next number
            operand = 0; // Reset operand for the next number
        } else if (ch == '-') {
            // Encountering '-' means we can compute the previous number
            result += sign * operand;
            sign = -1; // Set sign for next number
            operand = 0; // Reset operand for the next number
        } else if (ch == '(') {
            // On '(' push the result and sign onto the stack (for later)
            // Push the result first, and then the sign onto the stack, for later useage
            stack.push(result);
            stack.push(sign);
            // Reset the sign and result, as we are now dealing with a new subexpression
            sign = 1;
            result = 0;
        } else if (ch == ')') {
            // ')' ends the subexpression, complete the expression inside the parentheses, which is computing the previous number with the result so far
            result += sign * operand;
            // Pop the sign and calculate the subexpression result
            // The current result is multiplied by the sign popped from the stack
            result *= stack.pop(); // stack.pop() is the sign before the parenthesis
            // Then add to the result popped from the stack           
            result += stack.pop(); // stack.pop() now is the result calculated before the parenthesis
            // Reset the operand for the next number
            operand = 0;
        }
    }
    // Handle the last number and operand, then return the result
    return result + (sign * operand);
}
```

**Complexity Analysis:**
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. Each character is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case when all characters are nested in multiple sets of parentheses, requiring proportional space in the stack.

This solution uses a stack effectively to manage the challenges of nested expressions and varying signs, ensuring that each sub-expression is correctly evaluated according to mathematical rules. The clear separation of cases for digits, operators, and parentheses makes the logic easy to follow and debug.
