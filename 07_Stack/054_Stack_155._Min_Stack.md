# 054_Stack_155. Min Stack

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the `MinStack` class:

- `MinStack()` initializes the stack object.
- `void push(int val)` pushes the element `val` onto the stack.
- `void pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack.
- `int top()` gets the top element of the stack.
- `int getMin()` retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

You must implement a solution with `O(1)` time complexity for each function.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["MinStack","push","push","push","getMin","pop","top","getMin"]
[[],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[]]

Output
[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2]

Explanation
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin(); // return -3
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();    // return 0
minStack.getMin(); // return -2
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `-231 <= val <= 231 - 1`
- Methods `pop`, `top` and `getMin` operations will always be called on **non-empty** stacks.
- At most `3 * 104` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `getMin`.



### Intuition and Main Idea

The primary difficulty is maintaining the minimum element accessible at O(1) while ensuring that the basic stack operations also run in O(1). To achieve this, we considered the following approaches:

1. **Using Two Stacks**: Maintain a primary stack for all elements and a secondary stack to keep track of the minimum values.
2. **Using a Single Stack with Tuple Data**: Enhance each stack element to hold an additional piece of data - the minimum value at that point in the stack.

### Solution 1: Two Stacks Approach

This approach involves using an auxiliary stack (`minStack`) alongside the main stack (`stack`). The `minStack` holds the minimum values such that the top always contains the current minimum of the stack.

#### Implementation

```java
class MinStack {
    private Stack<Integer> stack;
    private Stack<Integer> minStack;
    public MinStack() {
        stack = new Stack<>();
        minStack = new Stack<>();
    }
    public void push(int val) {
        // Always push the value onto the main `stack`
        stack.push(val);
        // If minStack is empty or new value is less than or equal to current min
        if (minStack.isEmpty() || val <= minStack.peek()) {
            minStack.push(val);
        }
    }
    public void pop() {
        // If the top values of `stack` and `minStack` are the same, pop from both
        if (stack.peek().equals(minStack.peek())) {
            minStack.pop();
        }
        // If not, just pop from `stack`
        stack.pop();
    }
    public int top() {
        // Returns the top element of the main stack.
        return stack.peek();
    }
    public int getMin() {
        // Returns the top element of the `minStack`, which is the current minimum.
        return minStack.peek();
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis:**

- Time Complexity: O(1) for each operation.
- Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements pushed to the stack. This is because in the worst case, every element pushed could be the new minimum, and hence both stacks might hold n elements.

### Solution 2: Single Stack with Tuple Data

Enhance each stack element to hold an additional piece of data - the minimum value at that point in the stack.

This solution modifies each stack entry to hold both the value and the minimum up to that point.

#### Implementation

```java
class MinStack {
    // Each element in the stack is an array where the first element is the value and the second element is the minimum value at that point.
    private Stack<int[]> stack;
    public MinStack() {
        stack = new Stack<>();
    }
    public void push(int val) {
        // Push an array with the value and the current minimum, which is the smaller one of the value and the last minimum.
        if (stack.isEmpty()) {
            stack.push(new int[]{val, val});
        } else {
            int currentMin = stack.peek()[1];
            stack.push(new int[]{val, Math.min(val, currentMin)});
        }
    }
    public void pop() {
        stack.pop();
    }
    public int top() {
        return stack.peek()[0];
    }
    public int getMin() {
        return stack.peek()[1];
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis:**

- Time Complexity: O(1) for each operation.
- Space Complexity: O(n). Each element in the stack now holds an additional integer, but the space used still scales linearly with the number of elements in the stack.

### Conclusion

Both solutions maintain the minimum value of the stack accessible in O(1) time while supporting standard stack operations efficiently. The choice between the two can depend on readability preferences and slight nuances in memory usage (though both scale linearly). The two-stack approach might be slightly more intuitive as it separates the concerns of tracking stack values and minimum values, whereas the single stack approach with tuple data is slightly more space-efficient as it doesn't need to handle two separate stack data structures.
