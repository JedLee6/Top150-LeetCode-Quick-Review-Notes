# 053_Stack_71. Simplify Path

Given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which begins with a slash `'/'`, transform this path into its **simplified canonical path**.

In Unix-style file system context, a single period `'.'` signifies the current directory, a double period `".."` denotes moving up one directory level, and multiple slashes such as `"//"` are interpreted as a single slash. In this problem, treat sequences of periods not covered by the previous rules (like `"..."`) as valid names for files or directories.

The simplified canonical path should adhere to the following rules:

- It must start with a single slash `'/'`.
- Directories within the path should be separated by only one slash `'/'`.
- It should not end with a slash `'/'`, unless it's the root directory.
- It should exclude any single or double periods used to denote current or parent directories.

Return the new path.

**
Example 1:**

**Input:** path = "/home/"

**Output:** "/home"

**Explanation:**

The trailing slash should be removed.

 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** path = "/home//foo/"

**Output:** "/home/foo"

**Explanation:**

Multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** path = "/home/user/Documents/../Pictures"

**Output:** "/home/user/Pictures"

**Explanation:**

A double period `".."` refers to the directory up a level.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** path = "/../"

**Output:** "/"

**Explanation:**

Going one level up from the root directory is not possible.

**Example 5:**

**Input:** path = "/.../a/../b/c/../d/./"

**Output:** "/.../b/d"

**Explanation:**

`"..."` is a valid name for a directory in this problem.

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= path.length <= 3000`
- `path` consists of English letters, digits, period `'.'`, slash `'/'` or `'_'`.
- `path` is a valid absolute Unix path.



### Problem Understanding and Intuition

This problem requires transforming an absolute path into its simplified canonical path, which is common in file system operations. It involves understanding how Unix-like systems interpret paths, particularly with regard to navigating directories using `.` and `..`.

The main idea here is to use a stack to process each component of the path. The stack will help backtrack easily when encountering `..` (which means moving up one directory level), while ignoring `.` (which means staying in the current directory) and consecutive slashes.

### Java Implementation with Detailed Annotations

```java
public String simplifyPath(String path) {
    // Normalize the path by splitting it into components using "/".
    // This will handle multiple slashes since split ignores empty strings between separators.
    String[] components = path.split("/");
    // Use a stack to build the canonical path.
    Stack<String> stack = new Stack<>();
    // Process each component.
    for (String component : components) {
        // If the component is "..", which means we need to go up one directory, so we pop from stack unless it's empty (backtrack one directory).
        if (component.equals("..")) {
            if (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                stack.pop();
            }
        }
        // A single period '.' represents the current directory, a empty component represent consecutive slashes, so we can ignore "." or empty component
        else if (!component.equals("") && !component.equals(".")) {
            // Push the valid directory name onto the stack.
            stack.push(component);
        }
    }
    // Build the final simplified path from the stack, and each directory name is prefixed with `/`.
    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
    // The enhanced for loopinternally uses the collection's iterator to traverse the elements, which iterates in the order elements were added, rather than LIFO order.
    for (String dir : stack) {
        result.append("/").append(dir);
    }
    // Handle the special case of empty stack, which means the path is root "/".
    return result.length() == 0 ? "/" : result.toString();
}
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input path. We traverse each character of the path, and each operation on the stack (push or pop) is \(O(1)\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) in the worst case when the path contains many valid directory names that get pushed onto the stack.

### Alternative Approach: Using Deque for Optimized Front Operations
While the stack approach is straightforward and perfectly suitable for this problem, one could use a deque (double-ended queue) if front operations were necessary or if optimization in certain scenarios was required. This would allow for more flexible operations on both ends of the data structure but isn't necessary in this specific problem.
