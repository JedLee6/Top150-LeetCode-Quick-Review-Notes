# 055_Stack_150._Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

You are given an array of strings `tokens` that represents an arithmetic expression in a [Reverse Polish Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).

> In reverse Polish notation, the [operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)) follow their [operands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operand). For example, to add 3 and 4 together, the expression is 3 4 + rather than 3 + 4.

Evaluate the expression. Return *an integer that represents the value of the expression*.

**Note** that:

- The valid operators are `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'`.
- Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
- The division between two integers always **truncates toward zero**.
- There will not be any division by zero.
- The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
- The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a **32-bit** integer.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
Output: 9
Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
Output: 6
Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
Output: 22
Explanation: ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= tokens.length <= 104`
- `tokens[i]` is either an operator: `"+"`, `"-"`, `"*"`, or `"/"`, or an integer in the range `[-200, 200]`.



### Intuition and Main Idea
Reverse Polish Notation is a postfix mathematical notation where every operator follows all of its operands. It doesn't require parentheses as every operation order is defined by its position. This simplifies the computation using a stack:

1. **Push operands onto the stack**: When encountering numbers, push them onto a stack.
2. **Perform operations with operators**: When encountering an operator, pop the required number of operands from the stack, perform the operation, and push the result back onto the stack.
3. **Final result**: The final result of the expression will be the only number left in the stack.

#### Solution: Using Stack

```java
public int evalRPN(String[] tokens) {
    // Create a stack to manage the operands and intermediate results.
    Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
    // Iterate through each token in the given array
    for (String token : tokens) {
        // If the token is an operator, we need to pop the top two operands from the stack, apply the operation, and push the result back.
        if (token.equals("+") || token.equals("-") || token.equals("*") || token.equals("/")) {
            // Pop the top two operands from the stack
            int b = stack.pop();
            int a = stack.pop();
            // Perform the operation based on the operator and push the result back
            switch (token) {
                case "+":
                    stack.push(a + b);
                    break;
                case "-":
                    stack.push(a - b);
                    break;
                case "*":
                    stack.push(a * b);
                    break;
                case "/":
                    stack.push(a / b); // Division truncates towards zero in integer division
                    break;
            }
        } else {
            // If the token is a number, convert it to an integer and push it onto the stack
            stack.push(Integer.parseInt(token));
        }
    }
    // After processing all tokens, the final result is the only item left in the stack
    return stack.pop();
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Operators**: For operators, pop the top two operands from the stack, apply the operation, and push the result back.
- **Operands**: If it's a number, convert it to an integer and push it onto the stack.
- **Final Result**: After processing all tokens, the final result is the only item left in the stack.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of tokens. Each token is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), in the worst case, if all tokens are numbers, they all get pushed onto the stack.

#### Alternative Solution: Optimizing Memory Usage
We can optimize memory usage by reusing the tokens array itself as a stack to save space, though this is more complex and requires careful index management. For simplicity and clarity, the stack-based approach is generally preferred in interviews unless specified otherwise.

This approach to solving the problem efficiently uses O(1) space complexity in terms of additional data structures beyond the input, and the method is clear, systematic, and maintains the O(n) time complexity for processing.
