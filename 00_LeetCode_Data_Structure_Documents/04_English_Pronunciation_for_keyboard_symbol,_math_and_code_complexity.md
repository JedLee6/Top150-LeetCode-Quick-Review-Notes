## 2 Math Concept 数学概念

### 2.1 指数 exponent[ɪkˈspoʊnənt]

>exponent /ik'spounent/ n倡导者,(技能)擅长者;指数
>exponential /ekspe'nenshl/ a越来越快的(增长),指数的

As for **3^2**, 3 is the base value and 2 is the exponent. Exponents are also called powers. We can say `3 raised to the power of 2` to describe **3^2**,  or `3 to the second power`, or 3 raised to the power of 2. An exponent tells you how many times the base value is being multiplied by itself.

n^2 and n^3 are so common that they even have special names. When a number is raised to the second power, we say it's being squared. 5^2^ is also referred to as "5 squared". For numbers that are raised to the third power, we say that the number is being "cubed". 5^3^ is "5 cubed". 

### 2.2 对数 logarithm[ˈlɔːɡərɪðəm]

>   logarithmic[ˌlɔːɡəˈrɪðmɪk]a对数的

The *logarithm* of a positive real number *x* with respect to base *b* is the exponent by which *b* must be raised to yield *x*. In other words, the logarithm of *x* to base *b* is the unique real number *y* such that b^y^ = x. The logarithm is denoted "log~b~ *x*" (pronounced as "the logarithm of *x* to base *b*", "the base-*b* logarithm of *x*", or most commonly "the log, base *b*, of *x*"), such as log~2~16 = 4 is pronounced as "log base 2 of 16 is equal to 4". "logn = 16" is spelled as "log of n is equal to 16", and "O(nlogn)" is spelled as "o of  n times log of n".

### 2.3 模运算 modular arithmetic

>   model[ˈmɒdəl]n模型,模式,榜样,模特	module[ˈmɑːdʒuːl]n(机械,计算机)模块,(课程)单元	modulo[ˈmɒdjʊləʊ]prep以...为模	modulus[ˈmɒdʒələs]n模数	modular[ˈmɒdjʊlə]a(电脑)模块的,模数的	congruent[ˈkɒŋɡrʊənt] a合适的,(模数)全等的	remainder[rɪˈmeɪndər]n剩余的部分,余数	division[dɪˈvɪʒən]n除法	dividend[ˈdɪvɪdend]n股票利息,被除数	divisor[dɪˈvaɪzər]n除数

Given an integer n > 1, called a modulus, two integers a and b are said to be congruent modulo n, if n is a divisor of their difference, such as 15 is congruent to 12 modulo 3, which is `15 ≡ 12 (mod 3)`.给定一个大于1的整数n，我们把n称为模数，如果n是两个整数a和b的差的除数，则称a和b以n为模全等。

In programming domain, the modulus operator `%` returns the remainder of two numbers after division. Given two numbers, X and Y, X is the dividend and Y is the divisor, `X mod Y` is equal to the remainder of the division of X by Y, such as 16 mod 3 is equal to 1, which is written as `16 mod 3 = 1`.

|   <>   |        angle brackets, chevrons[ʃevrɑːns]尖括号        | In [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), chevrons (actually 'greater than' and 'less than' symbols) are used to bracket meta text. For example `<b>` denotes that the following text should be displayed as bold. Pairs of meta text tags are required – much as brackets themselves are usually in pairs. The end of the bold text segment would be indicated by `</b>`. This use is sometimes extended as an informal mechanism for communicating mood or tone in digital formats such as messaging, for example adding "\<sighs\>" at the end of a sentence. |
|   \    |            backslash, backward slash反斜杠             | The backslash `\` is a typographical mark used mainly in computing and is the mirror image of the common slash `/`. In many programming languages such as C, Python, JSON, the backslash is used as an escape character, to indicate that the character following it should be treated specially (if it would otherwise be treated normally), or normally (if it would otherwise be treated specially). For instance, inside a C string literal the sequence `\n` produces a newline byte instead of an 'n', and the sequence `\"` produces an actual double quote rather than the special meaning of the double quote ending the string. An actual backslash is produced by a double backslash `\\`. |
|   \|   |         vertical bar, vertical pipe, pipe竖线          | In many programming languages, the vertical bar is used to designate the [logic operation *or*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction).  `a|b` denotes a [bitwise *or*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR); whereas a double vertical bar `a||b` denotes a ([short-circuited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_evaluation)) [logical *or*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). |
|   ;    |               semicolon[ˈsemikoʊlən]分号               | A semicolon is the punctuation mark `;` which is used in writing to separate different parts of a sentence or list or to indicate a pause. |
|   :    |                   colon[ˈkoʊlən]冒号                   | A colon is the punctuation mark `:` which you can use in several ways. For example, you can put it before a list of things or before reported speech. |
|   ‘    | apostrophe[əˈpɑːstrəfi]撇号, prime, single quote单引号 | An apostrophe is the mark ' when it is written to indicate that one or more letters have been left out of a word, as in "isn't" and "we'll." It is also added to nouns to form possessives, as in "Mike's car." |
|   “    |          quotation mark, double quotes双引号           | quotation marks are placed in pairs around a word or phrase to indicate: quotation and scare quotes: Carol said "Go ahead" when I asked her if the launcher was ready. Scare quotes are used to  mean "so-called" or to express irony: The "fresh" bread was all dried up. |
|   ,    |                   comma[ˈkɑːmə]逗号                    | A comma is the punctuation mark , which is used to separate parts of a sentence or items in a list. |
|   .    |          period, decimal, dot, full stop句号           | A period is the punctuation mark (.) that you use at the end of a sentence when it is not a question or an exclamation. |
|   /    |                slash, forward slash斜杠                | A slash is a sloping line that separates letters, words, or numbers, for example, in 340/2/K.<br />slope [sloʊp]v倾斜n斜面,坡度 |

### 3.5 Modifier Keys for Mac and Windows

There are several modifier keys for both Mac and Windows. These keys perform special functions such as copy, paste, save, and print.

The [command key or ⌘ symbol on the Mac was first introduced in 1980.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_key) It allows many shortcuts on the Mac. The control key or Ctrl has a similar function in Windows.

## 5 Time Complexity and Space Complexity
In computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Since an algorithm's running time may vary among different inputs of the same size, one commonly considers the [worst-case time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worst-case_complexity), which is the maximum amount of time required for inputs of a given size. The time complexity is commonly expressed using big O notation, typically O(n), O(nlogn), etc.

 "O(nlogn)" is spelled as "o of  n times log of n", and "O(n!)" is spelled as "o of n factorial". O(n^2^ would be pronounced as "O of n squared." O(n^3^) would be pronounced as "O of n cubed." **3^2^ (3^2)** is spelled as `3 raised to the power of 2`.

Constant.  O(k) - Constant time algorithms have a running time independent of the input size.  Mathematical formulas for instance have fixed running times and are considered constant time.

Logarithmic. O(log(n)) - Logarithmic algorithms are often seen in trees.  It's best to think of "logarithmic" as the "height of the tree."  So, a binary search, for instance, often includes traversing down the height of a tree and can be considered logarithmic in time.  (Although, it may still be more accurate to say that for an unbalanced tree, the runtime is in the worst case linear.)  

Linear. O(n) - Most optimal algorithms run in linear time.  An easy way to identify this is to determine if you're visiting every node or item once and only once.  If you are, it is linear... it doesn't matter how many operations you're doing whether it's 1, 2, 3, or 4 lines of code you're executing per node.  Generally, you are still doing a constant amount of work per input.

Linearithmic. O(n*log(n)).  Most sorts operate in "n log n" time.  This includes popular sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, or heapsort.  (Actually, quicksort is O(n2) time in the worst-case scenario generally).

Quadratic or Cubic / Polynomial. O(n2) or O(n3).  Brute force algorithms often run in O(n2) or O(n3) time where you may be looping within a loop.  It's easy to identify if you see a for-loop inside a for-loop, where for each element i you iterate through another element j, for instance.  A common scenario is, given two arrays, find the common elements in each array where you would simply go through each element and check whether it exists in the other array.  This would execute in O(n*m) time, where n and m are the sizes of each array.  It's still great to name these brute force algorithms if you can identify them.

Exponential. O(2n).  Exponential algorithms are quite terrible in running time.  A classic example is determining every permutation of a set of n bits (it would take 2n combinations).  Another example is computing the fibonacci sequence fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2), where for each item, it requires the computation of two more subproblems.  

Factorial. O(n!).  These algorithms are the slowest and don't show up that often.  You might see this in combinatorial problems, or like a "traveling salesman" problem where given n nodes, you need to find the optimal path from start to finish.  In your first iteration, you have a selection of n cities to visit, then n-1 cities, then n-2 cities, n-3 cities, etc., until you reach the last city.   That runtime is n * (n -1 ) * (n - 2) * (n -3 ) ... 1 = O(n!).
