## 098_Trie_208.Implement_Trie_(Prefix_Tree)

A [**trie**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) (pronounced as "try") or **prefix tree** is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.

Implement the Trie class:

- `Trie()` Initializes the trie object.
- `void insert(String word)` Inserts the string `word` into the trie.
- `boolean search(String word)` Returns `true` if the string `word` is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and `false` otherwise.
- `boolean startsWith(String prefix)` Returns `true` if there is a previously inserted string `word` that has the prefix `prefix`, and `false` otherwise.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["Trie", "insert", "search", "search", "startsWith", "insert", "search"]
[[], ["apple"], ["apple"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"]]
Output
[null, null, true, false, true, null, true]

Explanation
Trie trie = new Trie();
trie.insert("apple");
trie.search("apple");   // return True
trie.search("app");     // return False
trie.startsWith("app"); // return True
trie.insert("app");
trie.search("app");     // return True
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= word.length, prefix.length <= 2000`
- `word` and `prefix` consist only of lowercase English letters.
- At most `3 * 104` calls **in total** will be made to `insert`, `search`, and `startsWith`.



## Initial Intuition

When we go through this problem, the core of a Trie is that each node represents a character, and paths from the root represent strings or prefixes. I'll need to implement three operations: insert, search, and startsWith.

For this problem, we can think about several approaches:



1. Brute-force with List. We could just use a `List<String>` to store all inserted words. Then use `startsWith()` and `equals()` for queries. This has **O(NÂ·L)** time complexity per query (N = total words, L = length).
2. Amother way is to use a tree structure where each node has references to its children (up to 26 children for lowercase English letters). 
3. Alternatively, we could use a Map-based approach where each node contains a map from characters to child nodes. it's easier to implement for Unicode but has **O(L)** per operation and more memory overhead due to `HashMap`.

Let's go with the Map-based approach as it's more generic."

## Trie with HashMap (Generic but slower)

Let's now explain this approach in detail:

Each node in our Trie will have:

1. A Map that maps characters to child nodes
2. A boolean flag to indicate if a word ends at this node

When we insert a word, we'll navigate through the Trie, creating nodes as needed, and mark the last node as the end of a word.

For searching, we'll traverse the Trie based on the characters of the word and check if the final node is marked as the end of a word.

For startsWith, we just need to verify if we can traverse the Trie using all characters in the prefix, without checking if it's the end of a word.

```java
// First, I'll define the Trie class and its node structure
class Trie {
    // This is our TrieNode class that will be used to build the Trie
    // Each node contains a map of children (one for each possible character)
    // and a flag to indicate if a word ends at this node
    private class TrieNode {
        // Map to store child nodes, with the character as the key
        Map<Character, TrieNode> children;
        // Flag to mark if this node represents the end of a word
        boolean isEndOfWord;
        // Constructor to initialize a new node
        public TrieNode() {
            // Initialize the children map
            children = new HashMap<>();
            // By default, a new node is not the end of a word
            isEndOfWord = false;
        }
    }
    // The root node of our Trie
    private TrieNode root;
    // Constructor to initialize the Trie with a root node
    public Trie() {
        // Create a new root node when a Trie is instantiated
        root = new TrieNode();
    }
    // Method to insert a word into the Trie
    public void insert(String word) {
        // Start from the root node
        TrieNode current = root;
        // Iterate through each character in the word
        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
            // If the current character doesn't exist as a child, create a new node
            if (!current.children.containsKey(c)) {
                current.children.put(c, new TrieNode());
            }
            // Move to the child node corresponding to the current character
            current = current.children.get(c);
        }
        // Mark the last node as the end of the word
        current.isEndOfWord = true;
    }
    // Method to search for a word in the Trie
    public boolean search(String word) {
        // Start from the root node
        TrieNode current = root;
        // Iterate through each character in the word
        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
            // If the current character doesn't exist as a child, the word is not in the Trie
            if (!current.children.containsKey(c)) {
                return false;
            }
            // Move to the child node corresponding to the current character
            current = current.children.get(c);
        }
        // Return true only if we've reached the end of the word AND the node is marked as the end of a word
        return current.isEndOfWord;
    }
    // Method to check if there's any word in the Trie that starts with the given prefix
    public boolean startsWith(String prefix) {
        // Start from the root node
        TrieNode current = root;
        // Iterate through each character in the prefix
        for (char c : prefix.toCharArray()) {
            // If the current character doesn't exist as a child, no word starts with this prefix
            if (!current.children.containsKey(c)) {
                return false;
            }
            // Move to the child node corresponding to the current character
            current = current.children.get(c);
        }
        // If we've successfully traversed all characters in the prefix, return true
        return true;
    }
}
```

Alright, that's all of the code. Let's submit our code and check if our solution passes all the test cases. Yes, our code got accepted. Now, Let's analyze the time and space complexity.

### Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

#### Time Complexity:

- **Insert**: O(m) where m is the length of the word. We need to traverse each character.
- **Search**: O(m) for the same reason.
- **StartsWith**: O(m) where m is the length of the prefix.

#### Space Complexity:

For the HashMap approach: O(n * m) where n is the number of words and m is the average length. In the worst case, if all words have unique prefixes, we'll have a node for each character of each word.

##  Trie with Fixed-size Array (Best for lowercase English letters)

We've mentioned that there's an alternative approach using an array instead of a Map for the children. Since we know we only have lowercase English letters, we can use a fixed-size array of 26 elements.

This approach can be more memory-efficient, as we don't need to store character keys, and lookup is O(1) instead of O(log n) for a Map. Let's implement this approach as well.

```java
// Here's the implementation using an array for children instead of a Map
class Trie {
    // This is our TrieNode class that will be used to build the Trie
    // Each node contains an array of children (one for each lowercase letter)
    // and a flag to indicate if a word ends at this node
    private class TrieNode {
        // Array to store child nodes, with indices corresponding to characters
        TrieNode[] children;
        // Flag to mark if this node represents the end of a word
        boolean isEndOfWord;
        
        // Constructor to initialize a new node
        public TrieNode() {
            // Initialize the children array with size 26 (for lowercase English letters)
            children = new TrieNode[26];
            // By default, a new node is not the end of a word
            isEndOfWord = false;
        }
    }
    
    // The root node of our Trie
    private TrieNode root;
    
    // Constructor to initialize the Trie with a root node
    public Trie() {
        // Create a new root node when a Trie is instantiated
        root = new TrieNode();
    }
    
    // Method to insert a word into the Trie
    public void insert(String word) {
        // Start from the root node
        TrieNode current = root;
        
        // Iterate through each character in the word
        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
            // Calculate the index for the current character (a=0, b=1, ...)
            int index = c - 'a';
            
            // If the child node for this character doesn't exist, create it
            if (current.children[index] == null) {
                current.children[index] = new TrieNode();
            }
            
            // Move to the child node corresponding to the current character
            current = current.children[index];
        }
        
        // Mark the last node as the end of the word
        current.isEndOfWord = true;
    }
    
    // Method to search for a word in the Trie
    public boolean search(String word) {
        // Start from the root node
        TrieNode current = root;
        
        // Iterate through each character in the word
        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
            // Calculate the index for the current character
            int index = c - 'a';
            
            // If the child node for this character doesn't exist, the word is not in the Trie
            if (current.children[index] == null) {
                return false;
            }
            
            // Move to the child node corresponding to the current character
            current = current.children[index];
        }
        
        // Return true only if we've reached the end of the word AND the node is marked as the end of a word
        return current.isEndOfWord;
    }
    
    // Method to check if there's any word in the Trie that starts with the given prefix
    public boolean startsWith(String prefix) {
        // Start from the root node
        TrieNode current = root;
        
        // Iterate through each character in the prefix
        for (char c : prefix.toCharArray()) {
            // Calculate the index for the current character
            int index = c - 'a';
            
            // If the child node for this character doesn't exist, no word starts with this prefix
            if (current.children[index] == null) {
                return false;
            }
            
            // Move to the child node corresponding to the current character
            current = current.children[index];
        }
        
        // If we've successfully traversed all characters in the prefix, return true
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

Let's analyze the time and space complexity of both approaches:

### Time Complexity:

- **Insert**: O(m) where m is the length of the word. We need to traverse each character.
- **Search**: O(m) for the same reason.
- **StartsWith**: O(m) where m is the length of the prefix.

### Space Complexity:

O(n * m * 26) in the worst case, as each node has an array of size 26. However, this can be more efficient when the Trie is dense (many shared prefixes).

## Summary

The array-based approach is generally more efficient in terms of both time (constant-time lookup) and space (no overhead of HashMap) for this specific problem where we only have lowercase English letters.

If we needed to support a larger character set or unknown characters, the HashMap approach would be more flexible.
