## 099_Trie_211._Design_Add_and_Search_Words_Data_Structure

Design a data structure that supports adding new words and finding if a string matches any previously added string.

Implement the `WordDictionary` class:

- `WordDictionary()` Initializes the object.
- `void addWord(word)` Adds `word` to the data structure, it can be matched later.
- `bool search(word)` Returns `true` if there is any string in the data structure that matches `word` or `false` otherwise. `word` may contain dots `'.'` where dots can be matched with any letter.

 

**Example:**

```
Input
["WordDictionary","addWord","addWord","addWord","search","search","search","search"]
[[],["bad"],["dad"],["mad"],["pad"],["bad"],[".ad"],["b.."]]
Output
[null,null,null,null,false,true,true,true]

Explanation
WordDictionary wordDictionary = new WordDictionary();
wordDictionary.addWord("bad");
wordDictionary.addWord("dad");
wordDictionary.addWord("mad");
wordDictionary.search("pad"); // return False
wordDictionary.search("bad"); // return True
wordDictionary.search(".ad"); // return True
wordDictionary.search("b.."); // return True
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= word.length <= 25`
- `word` in `addWord` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `word` in `search` consist of `'.'` or lowercase English letters.
- There will be at most `2` dots in `word` for `search` queries.
- At most `104` calls will be made to `addWord` and `search`.



## Initial Intuition

Looking at this problem, I can see we need to implement a data structure that supports two main operations: adding words and searching for words with a special pattern matching feature. The key challenge here is handling the dot character '.' which can match any letter.

Our first thought is to use a Trie (prefix tree) since we're dealing with strings and prefix operations. A standard Trie would work well for adding words and exact searches, but we need to extend it to handle the wildcard character.

We can think of a few approaches:

1. **Naive approach**: Store all words in a list and perform pattern matching for each search. This would be O(n*m) time for each search where n is the number of words and m is the average word length.

2. **Trie with backtracking**: Use a Trie for efficient storage and implement a recursive search that explores all possible paths when encountering a dot. This would be more efficient for exact searches and reasonable for wildcard searches.

3. **Trie with pattern indexing**: We could precompute and store patterns, but with the constraints allowing any position to have dots, this would lead to combinatorial explosion.

The Trie with backtracking seems most appropriate for this problem, offering a good balance of efficiency for both operations.

## Solution: Trie with Backtracking

Let me implement a solution using a Trie with backtracking for the wildcard search:

1. For adding words, we'll use a standard Trie insertion.
2. For searching, we'll use DFS with backtracking when we encounter a dot character.

Let's dive into the implementation:

```java
// First, I'll define the WordDictionary class with a TrieNode structure
class WordDictionary {
    // Define the TrieNode class which will be the building block of our Trie
    private class TrieNode {
        // Each node has up to 26 children, one for each lowercase letter
        TrieNode[] children;
        // Flag to indicate if a word ends at this node
        boolean isEndOfWord;
        
        // Constructor to initialize a new TrieNode
        public TrieNode() {
            // Initialize the children array with 26 slots (a-z)
            children = new TrieNode[26];
            // By default, a new node is not the end of a word
            isEndOfWord = false;
        }
    }
    // The root of our Trie
    private TrieNode root;
    // Constructor to initialize the WordDictionary
    public WordDictionary() {
        // Create a new root node when the dictionary is instantiated
        root = new TrieNode();
    }
    // Method to add a word to the dictionary
    public void addWord(String word) {
        // Start at the root of the Trie
        TrieNode current = root;
        // Iterate through each character in the word
        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
            // Calculate the index for the character (a=0, b=1, etc.)
            int index = c - 'a';
            // If the child node for this character doesn't exist, create it
            if (current.children[index] == null) {
                current.children[index] = new TrieNode();
            }
            // Move to the child node for the next iteration
            current = current.children[index];
        }
        // Mark the last node as the end of a word
        current.isEndOfWord = true;
    }
    // Method to search for a word in the dictionary
    public boolean search(String word) {
        // Call the helper method starting from the root
        return searchHelper(word, 0, root);
    }
    // Helper method for recursive search with wildcard support
    private boolean searchHelper(String word, int index, TrieNode node) {
        // Base case: if we've processed all characters in the word
        if (index == word.length()) {
            // The search is successful if we're at the end of a word
            return node.isEndOfWord;
        }
        // Get the current character we're processing
        char c = word.charAt(index);
        // If the current character is a dot (wildcard)
        if (c == '.') {
            // Try all possible children (all 26 letters)
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                // If this child exists
                if (node.children[i] != null) {
                    // Recursively search with this child and the next character
                    if (searchHelper(word, index + 1, node.children[i])) {
                        // If any path leads to a match, return true
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            }
            // If no path leads to a match, return false
            return false;
        } 
        // If the current character is a regular letter
        else {
            // Calculate the index for the character
            int charIndex = c - 'a';
            
            // If the child for this character doesn't exist, the word is not in the dictionary
            if (node.children[charIndex] == null) {
                return false;
            }
            // Recursively search with the next character
            return searchHelper(word, index + 1, node.children[charIndex]);
        }
    }
}

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

Let me analyze the time and space complexity of this solution:

### Time Complexity:
- **addWord(word)**: O(m) where m is the length of the word. We need to traverse each character once.
- **search(word)**: 
  - Best case (no wildcards): O(m) where m is the length of the word.
  - Worst case (all wildcards): O(26^m) which is exponential, as we might need to explore all possible paths in the Trie. However, given the constraint that there will be at most 2 dots in the search queries, the practical complexity is much more reasonable.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(n*m) where n is the number of words and m is the average word length. In the worst case, if all words have unique prefixes, we'll have a node for each character of each word.
- The recursive call stack for search can go up to O(m) depth.

### Factors influencing complexity:
1. The length of the words affects both time and space complexity linearly.
2. The number of wildcard characters dramatically affects search time.
3. The density of the Trie (how many shared prefixes) affects space efficiency.

### Trade-offs:
1. Using a Trie vs. a simple list:
   - Trie provides faster exact searches (O(m) vs O(n*m))
   - Trie uses more space for sparse word sets
   - Trie handles prefix operations more efficiently

2. Implementation choices:
   - Using an array vs. a HashMap for children:
     * Array: Faster access (O(1)), fixed memory for each node
     * HashMap: More flexible, better for sparse children, but slower lookup

The solution I provided is optimized for the constraints of this problem - particularly the limit of at most 2 dots in search queries, which keeps the backtracking reasonably efficient. If we expected more wildcards, we might need to consider additional optimizations or different approaches."

## Additional Insights

"One further insight: since the problem states there will be at most 2 dots in search queries, we could potentially optimize our backtracking by keeping track of how many wildcards we've already processed. This would allow us to fall back to more efficient exact matching once all wildcards are used.

Another optimization could be to implement the search iteratively rather than recursively to avoid call stack overhead, but the recursive approach is cleaner and easier to understand for this problem.

Also, if memory usage is a concern, we could implement a more compact Trie structure using a Map instead of an array at each node, especially if we expect the word set to be sparse (not using all 26 possible children at each node)."
